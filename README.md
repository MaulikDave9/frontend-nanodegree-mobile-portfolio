###Optimizations in index.html (To achieve score of at least 90 for Mobile and Desktop)

Use https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights to find the pagespeed before and after making the changes.
Some of the changes that enabled the pagespeed 90:

(1) Import web font, instead of href.
(2) "async" JavaScript 
(3) 'Cam's Pizzaria' image was very large, resize/optimize.
